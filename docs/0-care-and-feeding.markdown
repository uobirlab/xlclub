The touchpads are pretty shonky. They allow one and two finger taps. 

The keyboards are in German. If you see a `De` in the box in the top right of the screen in Ubuntu then you are using a German keymap, this means WYSIWYG for the keyboard. If you click in the box and switch it to `US` then you can type as you would normally. However, the login screen seems to always go be to German, so be careful with those passwords.

The USB port on the left of the laptop as you type is USB 3 port (you can tell by the blue inner). Do not plug the Kinect into this port as it does not work with USB 3.

They auto login to the `turtlebot` account. 

Do not upgrade the kernel. The last update wrecked the graphics...
